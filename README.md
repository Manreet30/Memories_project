## ℹ️ About the App

Memories is a user-friendly full-stack application designed to help users capture and share their favorite moments through photos. It mimics core social media features, focusing on simplicity and speed. Whether it’s a quick snapshot or a detailed post with tags and messages, users can easily create, update, and interact with content.

This project showcases the power of the MERN stack in building scalable, performant web applications with real-time interactivity. The use of React and Redux on the frontend ensures smooth UI updates, while Express and MongoDB handle data persistence and server-side logic effectively. Deployment on Render demonstrates modern cloud hosting capabilities for full-stack apps.

It’s an excellent portfolio project illustrating CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, state management, image handling, and responsive design.
